### CSV Tips

- First line can be a header (address,amount) or data
- Use one recipient per line
- Amounts should be in regular units (not wei)
- Maximum 200 recipients

## Examples

### Example 1: Send 1 HYPE to 3 addresses

```
Recipient 1: 0xABCD...1234, Amount: 1.0
Recipient 2: 0xEFGH...5678, Amount: 1.0
Recipient 3: 0xIJKL...9012, Amount: 1.0
Total: 3.0 HYPE
```

### Example 2: Send different amounts of USDC

```
Token Address: 0xUSDCAddress...
Recipient 1: 0xABCD...1234, Amount: 100
Recipient 2: 0xEFGH...5678, Amount: 250
Recipient 3: 0xIJKL...9012, Amount: 50
Total: 400 USDC
```

### Example 3: Airdrop 0.1 HYPE to 10 addresses

```
Check "Send equal amount to all recipients"
Amount per recipient: 0.1
Add 10 recipient addresses
Total: 1.0 HYPE
```

## Tips and Best Practices

### Gas Optimization

- The contract is optimized for batch sending
- Sending to 100 addresses costs much less than 100 individual transactions
- Consider batching in groups of 50-100 for optimal gas usage

### Address Validation

- The app validates addresses automatically
- Invalid addresses will be highlighted
- Double-check addresses before sending (transactions are irreversible!)

### Amount Formatting

- Use decimal notation (e.g., 1.5, not 1500000000000000000)
- The app handles wei conversion automatically
- For tokens with different decimals, the app reads the token contract

### Transaction Monitoring

- Transaction hash is displayed after submission
- You can view the transaction in HyperEVM explorer
- Wait for confirmation before closing the page

### Troubleshooting

**Transaction Fails**
- Check you have enough tokens for the total amount
- Check you have enough native tokens for gas
- Ensure all addresses are valid

**ERC20 Transfer Fails**
- Make sure you approved enough tokens
- Check token balance is sufficient
- Some tokens have transfer fees or restrictions

**Wallet Connection Issues**
- Refresh the page
- Try a different wallet
- Check you're on the HyperEVM network
